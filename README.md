### ðŸ‘‹ Mabuhay! Kamusta kayo?


I'm a Software Engineer and Node.js is my go-to language. 

I'm used to volunteer at [Women Who Code Manila](https://www.womenwhocode.com/manila/about) and [ULAP.org](https://www.ulap.org/) as a Lead.

I work a lot with Typescript and React at my current job but I also engage in DevOps, Cloud technology and API development.

Developing on AWS and GCP and aiming to get certified. 

- ðŸ’¬ There is always time. You just have to find it.
