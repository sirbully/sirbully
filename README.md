### 👋 Mabuhay! Kamusta kayo?


I'm a volunteer at Women Who Code Manila and a part-time teacher for Japanese students trying to learn English and IT at the same time. 

I'm a Javascript Developer and Vue is my favorite framework. 

Primarily into web development but I recently started developing on AWS and GCP and aiming to get certified. 

Also, trying to branch out to Mobile Development and DevOps. 

- 🔭 Working on a mobile app built in React Native and deploying websites on AWS

- ⚡ Quote: There is always time. You just have to find it.
