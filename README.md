### 👋 Mabuhay! Kamusta kayo?


I'm a Javascript Developer and Vue is my favorite framework. 

I'm a volunteer at Women Who Code Manila as a tech lead for Vue.

I'm a part-time teacher for Japanese students trying to learn English and IT at the same time. 

Primarily into web development but I recently started mobile development. 

Developing on AWS and GCP and aiming to get certified. 

Also, trying to branch out to Mobile Development and DevOps.
